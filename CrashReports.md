# Introduction #

Squeezer 0.6 and above can (optionally) send reports when something unexpected happens to make it easier for the developers to find and fix the problem.

Crash reports can be disabled entirely in Squeezer's preferences, and, if enabled, you can choose whether or not send them on a report-by-report basis.

Reports are sent using the open source [ACRA framework](http://code.google.com/p/acra/) and aggregated using [BugSense](http://www.bugsense.com).

Reports do not include any information that directly identifies you. They do include some information that uniquely identifies your Android device.

# Sample report #

This is an example crash report, generated by turning off wifi on one of the developer's Nexus S devices running Squeezer (this was a test to generate this report -- Squeezer does not actually crash if you disable WiFi).

## Stack trace ##

The stack trace shows the developers where in the code the problem occurred.

```

The following pairs of data are also included in the report.


| **Key** | **Value** | **Comment** |
|:--------|:----------|:------------|
| Remote IP | 178.197.232.85 | The IP address of your phone. This is included by ACRA and can not currently be disabled. When ACRA [issue 70](http://code.google.com/p/acra/issues/detail?id=70) is fixed Squeezer will not include this information. |
| Country | CH | The country determined by your IP address. This is included by ACRA and can not currently be disabled. When ACRA [issue 70](http://code.google.com/p/acra/issues/detail?id=70) is fixed Squeezer will not include this information. |
| Phone | Nexus S | Your phone model. Used so we can determine if crashes are happening with a specific model of phone. |
| OS | 2.3.4 | Your Android version. Used so we can determine if crashes are happening with a specific model of phone. |
| App Version | 0.6 | The version of Squeezer that crashed. |
