#summary What information is collected in crash reports?

= Introduction =

Squeezer 0.6 and above can (optionally) send reports when something unexpected happens to make it easier for the developers to find and fix the problem.

Crash reports can be disabled entirely in Squeezer's preferences, and, if enabled, you can choose whether or not send them on a report-by-report basis.

Reports are sent using the open source [http://code.google.com/p/acra/ ACRA framework] and aggregated using [http://www.bugsense.com BugSense].

Reports do not include any information that directly identifies you. They do include some information that uniquely identifies your Android device.

= Sample report =

This is an example crash report, generated by turning off wifi on one of the developer's Nexus S devices running Squeezer (this was a test to generate this report -- Squeezer does not actually crash if you disable WiFi).

== Stack trace ==

The stack trace shows the developers where in the code the problem occurred.
